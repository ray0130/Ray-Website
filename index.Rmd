Hey everyone!

My name is Ray Wen and I am currently a third year student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Statistics.
I am interested in Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Data Analysis, but I am also actively trying out different areas to broaden my view.

I am currently a member of Computation and Psycholinguistics Laboratory (CAP Labs) as a lab programmer under Professor Blair Armstrong. In this lab, I am working on a machine learning library PyLens, which is a Python version of the old machine learning library CLens. 

I currently live in Toronto but I am from Taiwan. I have also lived in Burnaby when I was little. 

My hobbies are cooking, making hand drip coffee Swimming and running are my go to sports.
